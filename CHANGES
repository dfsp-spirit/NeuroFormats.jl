NeuroFormats.jl Changes
=======================


Version 0.3.1
-------------
- Merge pull request by @JakobAsslaender that updates the compat and cleaned up the test code. Thanks for the contribution!


Version 0.3.0
--------------
- Add `write_label` function that can write a label dataframe to a FreeSurfer label file.
- Update package for latest Julia version: built with and for Julia 1.9.2, and update various dependencies accordingly.
- Update file format version of Manifest.toml to manifest_format = "2.0", which includes a Julia version.


Version 0.2.3
-------------
- Add `write_mgh` function that can write 4D data in FreeSurfer MGH and MGZ formats.


Version 0.2.2
-------------
- Add `vertex_colors` function that works on `FsAnnot` structs and computes per-vertex brain parcellation colors as `Colors.RGB`. Very handy for plotting.


Version 0.2.1
-------------
- Support reading MGH and MGZ 4D images in FreeSurfer format: `read_mgh`
- Much better API documentation for all return values, especially the structs.


Version 0.2.0
--------------
- BREAKING: no longer exports `interpret_fs_int24` function. This function was exported by accident and it is very unlikely that people used it.
- BREAKING: rename public `read_fs_surface` function to `read_surf`.
- Support reading the MRtrix TCK format: function `read_tck`.
- Support reading the TRK format used by the Diffusion Toolkit and TrackVis: `read_trk`.
- Support reading FreeSurfer label files: `read_label`.
- Support reading FreeSurfer brain surface parcellation files, a.k.a. annot files: `read_annot`.
- Add introduction page to documentation, fix generation of API docs. Document return types.
- Rename all internal functions by prepending the function name with an underscore, to discourage external use.


Version 0.1.0
--------------
- Initial release.
- Support reading and writing FreeSurfer curv files: `read_curv` and `write_curv`
- Support reading of FreeSurfer brain meshes: `read_fs_surface`
